# Project

## Description
All the code that will implement the weather station functions is stored in this directory. The [Eclipse CDT](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/tools.cdt) software has been used to compile this code. This software groups the programs in projects and the one shown in this folder is one of them. The compiler used is the one generated by Buildroot and is located in the path "**output/host/bin/**" inside the Buildroot files and has the prefix "**arm-buildroot-linux-uclibcgnueabihf-**". For the case of this project, the Buildroot files are located in the "**Documents**" directory of the user "**ubuntu**", so the complete path is "**/home/ubuntu/Documents/buildroot-2022.11.1/output/host/bin/**"
